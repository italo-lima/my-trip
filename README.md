After creating your account on [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/) and following the steps above, you just need to rename
the `.env.example` to `.env.local` (if you plan to run locally) and edit the keys there.

In order to create a token access, go to `Settings > API Access`, inside this page, find `Permanent Auth Tokens`,
create a Token Name and mark all queries possible. Save and get the token.

This project uses [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/), so you need to create an account there first.

- And add the following fields:

  - `Asset Picker` as `gallery`

- Schema > Add New Model with `Page` name
- And add the following fields:
  - `Single Line Text` as `heading`
  - `Slug` as `slug`
